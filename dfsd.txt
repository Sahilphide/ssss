# **WMT360: Metrics-Based Health and Performance Status for Infrastructure and Applications**

## **Abstract**
WMT360 is an advanced observability platform designed to address the complex monitoring challenges of modern applications deployed across diverse infrastructure environments. It provides a unified solution that integrates application and infrastructure metrics from multiple telemetry sources such as Prometheus, Loki, Splunk, and Watchtower. The platform significantly reduces Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) and Mean Time to Identify (MTTI) by offering comprehensive multi-layer monitoring, real-time alerts, drill-down dashboards, and support for custom business KPIs. This white paper details the innovative approach behind WMT360 and its impact on improving system reliability and operational efficiency.

## **Problem Statement**
Modern applications are often deployed across multiple infrastructure platforms, each with distinct telemetry methods. For instance:
- **WinDeploy/WebFarm**: Sends metrics/logs to Splunk.
- **Treadmill**: Sends metrics to Prometheus and logs to Splunk.
- **MKS**: Sends metrics to Prometheus and logs to Loki.

Each of these platforms consists of various critical components such as:
- **Infrastructure Components**: Databases, Load Balancers, NAS, Message Queues (Kafka), etc.
- **Compute Platforms**: WinDeploy, WebFarm, Treadmill, MKS.
- **Alerts**: Originating from different infrastructure platforms, affecting internal and external environments.
- **Business KPIs**: E.g., number of logged-in customers, transaction success rates, etc.

The lack of an integrated monitoring solution results in increased MTTR and MTTI, as teams must rely on multiple disparate dashboards (e.g., Splunk, Watchtower, Grafana, batch monitoring tools) for triaging and analysis.

## **Solution Overview**
WMT360 addresses these challenges by centralizing monitoring data across all major platforms, enabling rapid issue detection and resolution. The key features include:

### **1. Infrastructure Monitoring with Watchtower**
The WMT360 dashboard integrates with Watchtower to provide real-time insights into infrastructure performance. It tracks:
- **NAS**: I/O and usage percentage.
- **Treadmill**: Memory, CPU utilization, disk usage.
- **Zapp**: CPU idle time, I/O wait time, disk wait time.
- **MQ (Message Queue)**: Depth, dequeue rate, message age.
- **Load Balancer**: Health status and request distribution.
- **Kafka**: Latency rate, consumer latency rate.
- **DB2**: Health status and query performance.
- **MKS**: Memory count, CPU count.

Each metric is categorized into three health statuses:
- **Green (OK)**: Normal operation.
- **Yellow (Warning)**: Potential issue requiring attention.
- **Red (Critical)**: Immediate action required.

### **2. Application Health Monitoring Across Platforms**
WMT360 provides an integrated application monitoring solution across MKS, Treadmill, WinDeploy, and WebFarm with drill-down dashboards for deeper insights. Key categories include:
- **Application Metrics Monitoring**: Tracks individual application health based on EON IDs, identifying real-time downtime.
- **External Dependency Monitoring**: Monitors third-party services that an application depends on, reducing the risk of cascading failures.
- **Service Health on MKS**: Tracks the status of microservices under the same namespace.
- **Live Alerts for Treadmill and WinDeploy**: Displays real-time alerts on dashboards.
- **Platform-Specific Deployment Health Monitoring**: Provides instance-wise health status across various platforms.

### **3. Custom Business KPI Integration with Prometheus**
WMT360 allows applications and platforms to integrate their business-specific KPIs using Prometheus. Users can:
- Define and track custom business metrics.
- Customize dashboards to monitor operational goals.
- Improve decision-making with data-driven insights.

## **Innovative Aspects of WMT360**
1. **Reduced MTTR & MTTI**: Centralized data across all major components provides a 360-degree view, significantly improving issue resolution time.
2. **Comprehensive Multi-Layer Monitoring**: Combines infrastructure and application health monitoring in a single system.
3. **Platform-Specific Health Monitoring**: Enables tracking across MKS, Treadmill, WinDeploy, and WebFarm.
4. **Business KPI Integration**: Custom metric support enhances monitoring flexibility.
5. **External Dependency Monitoring**: Ensures a complete understanding of system health by tracking dependencies.
6. **Drill-Down Dashboards**: Provides deep insights into infrastructure and application metrics.
7. **Unified Monitoring Across Multiple Data Sources**: Integrates Prometheus, Watchtower, and platform-specific tools for a seamless experience.

## **Additional Enhancements for Future Development**
To further strengthen WMT360, we propose the following enhancements:
- **AI-Driven Anomaly Detection**: Implement machine learning models to detect anomalies in real-time.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast potential failures based on historical data.
- **Automated Remediation**: Enable self-healing capabilities based on pre-configured playbooks.
- **Distributed Tracing Integration**: Enhance visibility into service-to-service communications.
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Provide isolated views for different teams or organizations.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Ensure seamless scalability with Kubernetes and serverless architectures.

## **Conclusion**
WMT360 is a groundbreaking observability solution that provides real-time, centralized monitoring of applications and infrastructure across diverse platforms. By reducing MTTR and MTTI, enabling drill-down analytics, supporting business KPIs, and integrating multiple telemetry sources, WMT360 enhances operational efficiency and reliability. Future enhancements, including AI-driven insights and automated remediation, will further solidify its position as a leading monitoring solution for modern enterprises.
